    <h3>The Contrubution point break down, and How it equals real money.</h3>
    
    <p>User owned means that you have the means to actually use social media to make money! At least you can use our social media to make money, this is how that works.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Each use gets an account, that user gets hosting and other services included. On those persoanl accounts you don't get to get points for uploading unless otherwise told by staff. For a bonus or a one time gift.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However you do get contribution points for things you do to the main SourceSocial.me site such as changing elements, adding to the site, creating features you think will help, and where you are told you will earn points. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Points then equal ownership shares of sourcesocial.me those ownership shares are just like shares of any other company, they have real value as we make profits by selling upgraded services such as dedicated hostng and much more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When those profits are made they get split between the holding company that is the original investors, and those who over see the managment team (the business end). The Profits get split between the current share holders (the Users that have Points when they equal Owership shares). They do not get split based on the current shares avaliable to everyone they only get split among the current issued shares. </p>
          <br> 
          <p>what this means is if SourceSocial.me makes $1,000,000 dollars for the quarter and we have 1,000 users that currently have 10 shares each, 51% goes to the holding company Petrucci llc To take care of some things like reinvesting, and paying staff. the rest $490,000 dollars goes to the users based on the shares they own. so 10,000 shares are issued in this examples. So in this example Each share would equal $49 dollars that means In this example each user would be getting $490 dollars for the quater of the year. If profits stayed the same and For example shares did too users would make $1,960 dollars for the year. <strong>This is stricly an example!</strong> Future profits can not be know due to many variables.</p>
<br>
    <p>
        Point value is subject to change without notice, points are subject to lose due to inactive use including but not limited to personal pages becoming stale or unupdated. updates can be minor changes, they do not have to be full redesigns.   
          
          </p>
      <br>
          <p>
         All terms are subject to change at anytime Without notcie, is your duty to check on the terms every so often I recommend checking them before the start of every quarter.<br>
              
          In the case that an account is inactive for more than 30 days (30 days and 1 hour) Points start to decrease at the rate of 0.007 for the first day and in a compound intrest manner of times two everyday there after untill the points have reached zero. Once points start to be decreased at the current rate of points to shares you trassfer your shares back to sourcesocial.me for them to be given to active users. This company is user owned not inactive userowned.    
          </p>

<h3>The current point value</h3>
          <p> 
     <em>Point value is subject to change at any time without notice.</em> </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          Currenly 25 points equal 1 share of sourcesocial.me
